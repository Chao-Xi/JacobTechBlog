## What is Cloud Computing 

**Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources and applications via the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.** 

Cloud computing provides a simple way to access servers, storage, databases, and a broad set of application services over the Internet. Cloud computing providers such as AWS own and maintain the network-connected hardware required for these application services, while you provision and use what you need using a web application.
