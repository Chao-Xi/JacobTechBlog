# WorkSpaces


## What is Workspaces? 

**It's basically Virtual Desktop Infrastructure(VDI)**. 

**A WorkSpace is a cloud-based replacement for a traditional desktop.**

A WorkSpace is available as a bundle of compute resources, storage space, and software application access that allow a user to perform day-to-day tasks just like using a traditional desktop. 

A user can connect to a WorkSpace from any supported device (PC, Mac, Chromebook, iPad, Kindle Fire, or Android tablets) using a free Amazon WorkSpaces client application and credentials set up by an administrator, or their existing Active Directory credentials if Amazon WorkSpaces is integrated with an existing Active Directory domain.
