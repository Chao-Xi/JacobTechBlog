# Azure Administration: Manage Subscriptions and Resources

## 1. Manage Azure Subscriptions


### Assign administrator roles overview

**Classic**

* Account Administrator: **Full access** 
* Service Administrator:  
	* **Manage services** 
	* Assign user to the Co-Administrator role 
* Co-Administrator 
	* **Same as Service Administrator with limitations** 

**Role-Based Access Control**

* Owner 
* Contributor 
* Reader
* User Access Administrator 
* 70 built-in roles 
* Custom roles 

**Owner**

* Full access to all resources 
* Delegate access to others 
* Equivalent to the Service Administrator and Co-Administrator role in the classic model 


**Contributor**

* Cannot delegate access to other users 
* Create and manage resources 

**Reader** 

* View Azure resources only 

**User Access Administrator**

* Special account 
* Privilege at the root scope (`/`) 
* Temporary access only (recommended)
* Azure AD, not subscription 

**Azure AD Administrators**

* **Manage Azure AD resources** 
	* Create, edit, reset user passwords, manage licenses, and more 
* **Several Azure AD roles** 
	* Global, Billing, Device, Information Protection, User Account, and more 

**Service Administrator** 

* Same as the Account Administrator (person who signed up for the account) 
* **Typically changed for migrations** 
* If the Service Administrator is changed, the Account Administrator loses access to the portal 
* **Cannot add a user who is not in the directory** 

> For example, `Sharon@bennettbiz.ca` can add `Watson@bennettbiz.cbu`t not `watson@oldbennettbiz.ca `


### Configure cost center quotas and tagging

**Azure Spending Limit**

* Free trial, Visual Studio, Azure in Open (AIO), or BizSpark subscription **will be disabled when the credits are consumed**

**Resource Tags** 

* Tag your resources 
* Name and value 
	* Finance: Production; Finance: Dev 
* **Fifteen tags per resource** 
* Write access to the resource to apply a tag 
* Portal, PowerShell, Azure CLI, template, REST API 

### Azure Policy overview

**Azure Policies**

* Set of rules to ensure compliance 
* Scans resources and provides reporting 
* **Used to ensure SLAs and corporate policies are met** 

**Azure Policy Assignment Options**

* Policy 
	* Individual polices

## 3. Manage Resource Groups


### Allocate resource policies using PowerShell

```
# Create the Assignment Of virtual machines not using managed disks.
$RG = Get-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name 'AZ-100' 
$Definition - Get-AzureRmPolicyDefinitipn Where-Object { $_.Properties DisplayName 'Audit VMs that do not use managed disks'}

New-AzureRmPolicyAssignment -Name 'VM-manageddisks' -DisplayName 'Virtual Machines without Managed Disks ' -Scope $RG.ResourceId -policyDefinition  $Definition

#List Policies 

Get-AzureRmPolicyDefinition 

#Identify the non-compliant resources 
 
$PolicyAssignnt = Get-AzureRmPolicyAssignment | Where-Object { $_.Properties. DisplayName eq 'Virtual Machines without Managed Disks'}

$PolicyAssignrrent.PolicyAssignmentId 

#Get the list of virtual machines without Managed Disks 
armclient post "/subscriptions/<subscriptionID>/resourceGroups/<rgName>/providers/Microsoft.PolicyInsights/policyStates/late.." 

#Remove the Assignment 
Get-AzureRMResourceGroup -Name 'AZ-100' 

Remove-AzureRmPolicyAssignment -Name 'VM-manageddisks' -Scope 
```


### Configure and apply resource locks

**Resource Lock Overview** 

* Control access Subscription Resource group Resource 
* Prevents accidental deletion or modification of resources

**Type of lock** 

* <span style="color:red">`CanNotDelete`</span> 

Read and modify but not delete a resource 

* <span style="color:red">`ReadOnly`</span> 

Read but not modify, delete, or update a resource Can lead to unexpected results 


**Lock Hierarchy**

* Parent-child relationship 

	* Locks applied at the parent scope affect all resources within that scope 
	* **Most restrictive lock takes precedence** 


**Permissions Required to Apply a Lock**

* `Microsoft.Authorization/*` 
* `MicrosoftAuthorization/locks/*` 
* Owner 
* User Access Administrator 

**How Locks Are Assigned** 

* Portal 
* PowerShell 
* Azure CLI 
* Template 
* Rest API 


```
#Lock a RG 
New-AzureRmResourceLock -LockName NoDelete -LockLevel CanNotDelete -LockNotes "Can not Delete Resources" -ResourceGroupName -ResourceGroupName 'AZ-100'

#View all Locks in subscription 
Get-AzureRmResourceLock 

#View all locks for a RG 
Get-AzureRmResourceLock -ResourceGroupName 'AZ-100' 

# Delete a Lock 
Remove-AzureRmResourceLock -LockName NoDelete -ResourceGroupName 'AZ-100' 
```


### Implement and set tagging on resource groups using PowerShell

```
#View Tags 
Get-AzureRmTag 

#Create a New Tag 
New-AzureRmTag -Name "IT" -Value "Dev" 

#Assign a Tag to a Resource Group 
Set-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name "AZ-100" -Tag @{IT 'Prod'} 

#View Tags 
Get-AzureRmTag -Name "IT" 

#Add Tags to a Resource 
$resource Get-AzureRmResource -ResourceName 'Server2012R2' -ResourceGroupName 'AZ-100' Set-AzureRmResource -Tag @{ IT "Dev"} -ResourceId Sresource ResourceId -Force 

# Remove Tag From Resource Group 
Set-AzureRmResourceGroup -Tag @{} -Name 'AZ-100' 

#Remove Tag From Resource 
Set-AzureRmResource -Tag @{} -ResourceId Sresource ResourceId -Force 

#Remove Tag 
Remove-AzureRmTag -Name "IT" 
```


### Moving resources overview

**Moving Resource**

* *<span style="color:red">Move resources to a new subscription</spam>* 
* Move resources to a resource group in the same subscription 
* Portal, PowerShell, Azure CLI, or REST API 


**Considerations**

* Resources are locked during the move 
	* Cannot add, update, or delete the resource while the resource is being moved 
	* Applications using the resource are still available 
* The location of the resource does not change
* Not all resources can be moved 

**Subscription Requirements** 

* Different subscriptions 
	* Must exist in the same Azure Active Directory tenant 
* Resource provider must be registered for the destination subscription 
	* `Microsoft.Compute` must be registered for a virtual machine 

	
### Move resources across resource groups	

**Permissions Required to Move Resources** 

* source resource group

Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups/`moveResources/action` 

* Destination resource group

Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups/`write`

**Subscription Quotas** 

* Ensure you will not exceed subscription quotas 
* If the limits are exceeded, can you increase the limits? 

**Chunk Down Resources**

* **Resource Manager can move 800 resources per move** 
* May also experience time-outs if less than 800 


**Validate the Move Request** 

* Tests the validity of the move without moving the resources (optional)
* Response code: 202 Validation request was accepted 
* Response code: <span style="color:red">204 The move was validated successfully</span> 


**Virtual Machine Limitations**

* Marketplace with plans attached are not movable 
	* Redeploy in the new resource group or subscription 
* Cannot move virtual machine with certificates stored in the **Key Vault across subscriptions** 
	* Move to different resource group in the same subscription 
* Cannot move virtual machine scale sets 
	* Standard SKU load balancer 
	* Standard SKU public IP 
* **Virtual machines using Azure backup** 
	* Workaround available 


**Managed Disks Are Now Move Supported** 

* Virtual machines with managed disks 
* Snapshots created from managed disks 
* Availability sets with virtual machines that use managed disks 
* Managed disks 

**Virtual Network Considerations**

* All resources dependent on the VNet must be moved 
* Peered networks must first be **un-peered, moved, and re-peered again** 
* Subnets with resource links cannot be moved to a different subscription 
	* For example, a subnet with a Redis Cache resource cannot be moved 


### Remove resource groups

```
# Lists all resource IDs in the resource Groups 
Get-AzureRmResource -oDataQuery "'$filter=resourcegroup eq 101dRGPS'" | Format-Table -Property ResourcelD 

# Move Resources 
Move-AzureRmResource -DestinationResourceGroupName "NewRGPS" -ResourceId "" 

Get-AzureRmResource -oDataQuery "'$filter=resourcegroup eq 'NewRGPS'" | Format-Table -Property ResourceID 

Remove-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name 'NewRGPS' 
```
