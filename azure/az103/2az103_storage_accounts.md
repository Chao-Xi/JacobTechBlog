# Managing Azure storage

## Create and configure storage accounts

### Types of Storage Accounts

* Blobs: **unstructured data** 
* Files: **shared files in the cloud or on-premises** 
* Queues: **messaging** 
* Tables: **NoSQL store** 


![Alt Image Text](images/2_1.png "Body image")

### Types of Blob Storage 

* **Block blobs** 
	* Test and binary data 
* **Append blobs** 
	* Append operations, such as **logging data** 
* **Page blobs** 
	* Virtual Hard Disk (VHD) files 


### General-Purpose Storage Accounts 

* **Standard** 
	* Magnetic drives

>  This type of storage is great for test and dev and non-production environments

* **Premium storage** 
	* Only page blobs are supported, such as virtual machine disks 99.99% SLA without requiring an availability set 

> Microsoft recommends for all virtual machines 

### Storage Account firewall

* **Default rule accepts all connections** 
* **<span style="color:red">Add allowed IP addresses</span>** 
* Exceptions are used for **trusted Microsoft services**, read access **to storage logging, or metrics from any network**

### Configrue Network Access to storage Account

* Only traffic from allowed VNet can access the storage account 
* Set the default rule network access to deny to **only allow traffic from specific networks** 
* **User must have `Join Service` to a Subnet permission** (Storage 
Account Contributor role) 

> Be careful that you don't lock yourself out, and not anyone can configure these virtual networks.

### Generate a Shared Access Signature

* Allow access **without sharing the account keys** 
* Using account keys allows administrative access 
* Set permissions 
* **Set start and expiry dates** 

![Alt Image Text](images/2_4.png "Body image")


### Access Keys 

* Authenticate applications when requesting access to the storage account
* Keep the keys safe and don't share them 
* Microsoft recommends regenerating the keys regularly 
* **After regeneration, apps and resources will need to be updated** 


### Regenerating Access Keys

1. **Update the application to use key 2**. 
2. Regenerate key 1. 
3. **Update the application to use key 1**. 
4. Regenerate key 2.

### Azure Storage Replication 

* **Locally redundant storage (LRS)**: replication within a storage scale unit (same datacenter) 
* **Zone-redundant storage (ZRS)**: replicates data synchronously over three availability zones 
* **Geo-redundant storage (GRS)**: replication to another region 
* **Read-access georedundant storage (RA-GRS)**: replication to another region with read access 


### Key Points

## Configure Azure files


**How to configure Azure files and the Azure File Sync service.**

### create the Azure file share

* With Portal

![Alt Image Text](images/2_11.png "Body image")

* With PowerShell

```
#Create a context (storage account name and account key) 
$storageContext New-AzureStorageContext storage-account-name> storage-account-key> 

#Create a file share 
New-AzureStorageShare logs -Context $storageContext 
```

### Azure File Sync Service 

* <span style=color:red>**Azure becomes the repository for shared files**</span> 
* Files can be accessed from **on-premises systems, cloud app, or systems** 
* Supports cloud tiering 

![Alt Image Text](images/2_12.png "Body image")


### Steps to Create the Azure File Sync Service 

1. Install the agent on **Windows Server 2012 R2 or Windows Server 2016** 
2. Register the server 
3. Deploy **Storage Sync in Azure** 


### What Azure File Sync Supports 

* Windows Server 2012 R2 or Windows Server 2016 
* New Technology File System (NTFS) volumes/compression 
* **BitLocker, Azure Information Protection (AIR), Azure Rights Management (RMS), Active Directory Rights Management Service (AD RMS)**
* **Distributed File System (DFS) with agent 1.2** 


### What Azure File Sync Doesn't Support 

* File systems other than Windows Server 2012 R2 or Windows Server 2016 â€¢
* Sysprepped systems 
* **NTFS Encrypted File System (EFS)** 

### Create Azure Sync Group

* **Define the topology**

![Alt Image Text](images/2_13.png "Body image")

* Provide the **group name, your subscription, select the storage account and the file share**
* Add in two endpoints, 
	* The first endpoint being the **cloud endpoint, and this endpoint will point to the Azure file share**. 
	* **The second endpoint is the server endpoint**, and this will be the **path on that registered server**

	
### Endpoints 

* A cloud endpoint: **points to the Azure file share** 
* A server endpoint: **the path on the registered server** 


![Alt Image Text](images/2_14.png "Body image")

#### Troubleshoot Azure File Sync

* **Never remove the endpoint as the first step** 
* Ensure the agent is being installed with elevated privilege
* Move the primary domain controller (PDC) role to Windows Server 2012 R2 or late
* **Be sure to unregister servers that are no longer used** 


### Key Points 

* Know the troubleshooting steps to resolve a file sync issue 
* Understand what Azure File Sync doesn't support 
* Practice installing Azure File Sync, which includes several steps 
and takes time 
* Know all the steps to configure Azure File Sync 

## Implement Azure backup
