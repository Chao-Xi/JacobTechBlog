### Top Three RBAC Roles

* **Owner** 
	* Full access to all resources 

* **Contributor** 
	* Cannot delegate access to other users but can create and manage resources 

* **Reader** 
	* View Azure resources only 


### Assign RBAC Administrative Permissions

![Alt Image Text](images/1_4.png "Body image")

* **Do at the subscription level.**
* Select the role (**Owner, Contributor, Reader or  70 built-in roles**)
* Assign access to Azure AD user, group, or application 
* Select user 

### User Access Administor

**Special account that allows you access to all the Azure resources at the `root scope`**

* Special account 
* Privilege at the root scope (`/`) 
* Temporary access only (recommended)
* Azure AD, not subscription 


![Alt Image Text](images/1_5.png "Body image")

**Properties** => **Access Management for Azure resources**

### Configure Cost Center Quotas (`Exam`)

<span style="color:red">**Subscription level** => **Usage & Quotas** => **Current usage of resources**</span>

### Resource Tags 

* Sort resources based on tag 
* Name and value 
	* Finance: Production; Finance: Dev 
* **Fifteen tags per resource** 
* Write access is required to apply tags to a resource 


### Apply tags using PowerShell by simply using the command line

**Color Formatting - HTML**

```
# Apply tags to a Resource without tags 
Set-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name RGName -Tag @{ Dept "IT"; Environment "Prod" } 

# Remove Tags from a resource group 
Set-AzureRmResourceGroup -Tag @{} -Name RGName 
```
### Azure Policies

* Set of rules to ensure compliancy 
* **Scan resources and provide reporting** 
* Used to ensure SLAs and corporate policies are met 
* Applied to subscriptions and resources 

![Alt Image Text](images/1_6.png "Body image")

### Azure Policy Assignment Options 

* Policy 
	* Individual polices 

* Initiative 
	* Groups of individual polices 

### Three components of policy (Policy & Initiative)

#### 1.Policy and Initiative Definition

**Conditions that the policy or initiative will report on and enforce if configured to do so**

![Alt Image Text](images/1_7.png "Body image")

#### 2.Policy and Initiative Assignment

* Applying the initiative or policy **to a scope**
* Assignments are **inherited by all child resources**

![Alt Image Text](images/1_8.png "Body image")

#### 3.Policy and Initiative Parameter

* **Reduce the number of definitions** 
* Use generic values 
* Example: locations allowed

* Know how to create an action group 
* **<span style="color:blue">Understand how often notifications are sent to an action group</span>**


 
## Manage resource groups

### Create Action Group

* Resource policies can be applied to the resource group 
* Policy then only applies to the resource group, **not the entire subscription** 

![Alt Image Text](images/1_13.png "Body image")

### Resouce Lock 

* Controls access 
* Prevents accidental deletion or modification of resources 
* The lock can be applied 
	* Subscription 
	* Resource group 
	* Resource 


![Alt Image Text](images/1_14.png "Body image")

### Types of Locks 

* <span style="color:red">`CanNotDelete`</span> 

Read and modify but not delete a resource 

* <span style="color:red">`ReadOnly`</span> 

Read but not modify, delete, or update a resource Can lead to unexpected results 

>  When you use a ReadOnly lock, it can lead to unexpected results when applied to some resources because the resource itself may need additional actions to function. 


### Lock Hierarchy 

* **Parent-child relationship** 

	* Locks applied at the parent scope affect all resources within that scope 
	* **Most restrictive lock takes precedence** 

### Permissions Required to Apply a Lock 

* `Microsoft.Authorization/*` 
* `MicrosoftAuthorization/locks/*` 
* Owner 
* User Access Administrator 


### Locks Using PowerShell 

```
#Lock a Resource Group 
New-AzureRmResourceLock -LockName NoDelete -LockLevel CanNotDelete -LockNotes "Can not Delete Resources" -ResourceGroupName 'AZ-100' 

#View All Locks in Subscription and Resource Group 
Get-AzureRmResourceLock 
Get-AzureRmResourceLock -ResourceGroupName 'AZ-100' 

#Delete a Lock 
Remove-AzureRmResourceLock -LockName NoDelete -ResourceGroupName 'AZ-100' 
```

### Moving Resource to Another Resource Group


* The location of the resource does not change 
* **Not all resources can be moved** 
* Resources are locked during the move 


![Alt Image Text](images/1_15.png "Body image")

### Moving Resource to Another Subscription

* Must exist **in the same Azure Active Directory** tenant (transfer ownership or add a new Azure subscription) 
* Resource provider must be **registered for the destination subscription** 
* Check to ensure you will **not exceed subscription quotas** 

![Alt Image Text](images/1_16.png "Body image")

### Permissions Required to Move Resources 

* **Source resource group**

Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups/`moveResources/action` 

* **Destination resource group** 

Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups/`write`


### Move Resources to Resource Group 

```
#Move Resources to Another Resource Group 

Move-AzureRmResource -DestinationResourceGroupName "NewRGPS" - ResourceId "/subscriptions/81XXXXXXX/resourceGroups/MARGPS/ providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/az100vnet" 
```

### Remove Resource Group

* Removes all resources in the resource group 
* **Some resources need to be manually removed before the resource group can be deleted** 

![Alt Image Text](images/1_17.png "Body image")

### Remove Using PowerShell 

```
#Remove a Resource Group 
Remove-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name ResourceGroup 
```

### Key Points 

* Azure policies can be applied to the resource group level instead of the subscription level 
* Know the permissions required to move a resource group 
* Understand the relationship between resources when applying locks
* Know that applying a read-only lock may have unforeseen consequences 


## Manage role-based access control


### RBAC Role

* Azure Active Directory(top level).
* Azure Active Directory manage **Users and Groups** and **assign our Azure Administrative Roles**. 

* **RBAC Roles(subscription level)** 

	* Each subscription contains Resource Groups and Resources. 
	* Your RBAC Roles can be assigned to any of those levels.

![Alt Image Text](images/1_18.png "Body image")

### Azure AD Admin Roles vs. RBAC (difference)

* RBAC roles provide **access management to Azure resources** 
* Azure AD roles used to **manage Azure AD resources** 
	* Manage users 
	* Assign admin roles 
	* Reset passwords 
	* Manage licenses 
	* Manage domains 

### Type of RBAC Roles 

* Owner 
* Contributor 
* Reader

* **Managed identity** 
	* Cloud apps that need to authenticate to Azure AD 


### Role definition (permissions)

* Actions 
* Not actions 


![Alt Image Text](images/1_20.png "Body image")

### Scope
