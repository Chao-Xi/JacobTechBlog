* **Subdomains are automatically verified** 
* `production.bennettbiz.ca` 

> Example here: `production.bennettbiz.ca` would be automatically verified if `bennettbiz.ca` was also verified


**You must have alrady purchased this domain through register**

### Configure self-service password reset

**Password reset - properties**

![Alt Image Text](images/10_4.png "Body image")

> By default, password reset with multi-factor authentication is enabled by admins

**Authenticate methods**

![Alt Image Text](images/10_5.png "Body image")

**Notifications:**

![Alt Image Text](images/10_6.png "Body image")

> Notifications are optional will let the user know the password's been reset, set it to let the administrators know when other admins reset their password

**Customization**

![Alt Image Text](images/10_7.png "Body image")

> In Customization dekstop can provide helpdesk link for more information if they run into trouble

**On-premise integration**

![Alt Image Text](images/10_8.png "Body image")

Finally, if you are using Azure Active Directory connect to synchronize on-premises identities with Azure Active Directory, you can enable write back passwords to your on-premises directory and allow users to unlock accounts without reseting their password

**Administrators will always have two-factor authentication applied when they reset passwords**


### Manage multiple directories

**Azure AD Overview**

* A domain name can only be used by a single Azure AD 
* The creator of the tenant is a global administrator 
* Other administrators do not have access to the directory unless granted permission
*  Deleting the subscription does not delete the directory 


**Delete an Azure AD** 

* Delete all users 
* Delete all applications 
* Disable MFA 
* Remove all subscriptions for other Microsoft Online services 
* Must have a one global administrator who can delete the directory 

**Switch Directory**

**Delete Directory**

![Alt Image Text](images/10_10.png "Body image")

### Azure AD Join overview

**Device Management Options**

* Registering 
* Joining 
* Hybrid Azure AD joined 


**Device Registration** 

* Register to Azure AD 
* Identity is assigned to the device  
* Authenticate the device to Azure AD 
* Enable or disable the device 
* Combine with mobile device management (MDM) for conditional access 

**Device Joining** 

* Extension of registering 
* Changes the state of the device 
	* Users sign in with an organization or school account instead

	*  The user must manually connect their Office 365 and LinkedIn accounts.

## 3. Implement and Manage Hybrid Identities

### Azure Active Directory Connect overview

**Azure Active Directory Connect**

![Alt Image Text](images/10_21.png "Body image")

**Azure AD Connect** 

* Authentication 
	* Users 
* Synchronization 
	* Users, groups, and more 
* Health monitoring 

**Hybrid Identity and Azure AD Authentication Methods** 

* Cloud authentication 
	* Password hash synchronization (PHS) 
	* Pass-through authentication (PTA)
* Federation (AD FS) 
* All provide single sign on for domain joined devices that are on the corporate network 

**Password hash synchronization (PHS)**

![Alt Image Text](images/10_22.png "Body image")
 
**Password Hash Synchronization (PHS)** 

* Syncs on-premises password to Azure AD 
* Use the same password for both on-premises and in the cloud 
* **Password hashes are stored in Azure AD** 
* **Password writeback, if enabled**, will write the password back to on-premises AD if the password is changed in the cloud 
* Default authentication when using Azure AD Connect Express 

**Pass-through authentication (PTA)** 

![Alt Image Text](images/10_23.png "Body image")

* Users can sign in to on-premises or cloud-based applications using the same password 
* Password writeback, if enabled, will write the password back to on-premises Active Directory if the password is changed in the cloud 
* **Password hashes are not stored in the cloud** 
* Passwords are checked against the on-premises Active Directory for increased security 
* **Microsoft recommends configuring for high availably** 


**Federation (AD FS)**

![Alt Image Text](images/10_24.png "Body image")

* Authentication occurs on-premises 
* **Once authenticated user is granted access to the cloud resources** 

**On-Premises AD Requirements** 

* Forest functional level must be Server 2003 or later 
* **Password writeback requires the DC to Server 2008 R2 or later** 
* AD schema version must be Server 2003 or later 
* **The DC must be writeable** — read-only domain controller (RODC) is not supported 
* NetBIOS names cannot include a period 
* Microsoft recommends enabling the AD Recycle Bin 

**Azure AD Connect Server Requirements** 

* Windows Server only — not Small Business Server (SBS) or Essentials 
* Install on a member server not on a DC 
* Full GUI not supported on Server Core 
* Server 2008 R2 or later 
* Group Managed Service Account requires Server 2012 or later 

**Federation (AD FS)** 

* A federation server Server 2012 R2 
* A Web Application Proxy - Server 2012 R2 
* **An SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) certificate**
* Configure name resolution

### Quiz

1. Users are complaining about having to use MFA when they're in the office. You're asked to remove this requirement. How do you do this?
	*  Configure the office IP address as a trusted IP in MFA service settings.
2. Abid is working in a location where cell service is unavailable for the next three hours, so he can't use MFA to authenticate. What can the Azure administrator configure to ensure Abid doesn't need to use MFA for the next three hours?
	* `Enable one-time bypass`
3. You are importing MFA status updates for bulk users, and some statuses have not been applied to the user. How do you correct the issue?
	* Create the user first in Azure AD.
	* **MFA status updates can't be applied if the user doesn't exist.**
