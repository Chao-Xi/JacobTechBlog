**Virtual Network Overview** 

* Isolation and segmentation from other virtual networks 
* Communication between the resources in the network 
* Allows for external communication 
* Filter and Route traffic 
* Connect virtual networks 


**Isolation & Segmentation** 

* Multiple VNets per region and subscription 
* Further isolate or segment using subnets 
* By default traffic is routed between all subnets in a 
	* **VNet Network Security Groups** 
	* **Network Virtual Appliances** 


**Virtual Network Subnet**

* Subnets must a part of the virtual network address space 
* Subnets can not overlap 
* Use a **`service endpoint` to restrict access to a resource, such as Azure storage** 

![Alt Image Text](images/9_3.png "Body image")


**External Communication**

* Internet 
	* Outbound access is allowed by default 
	* Inbound requires public IP 

* On-premises 


**Filter and Route Traffic**

* Network Routes 
* Network Security Groups 
* Network Virtual Appliances 

**Virutal Network Subnet**

* Same or different regions 
* Different subscriptions 
* Seamless communications 

![Alt Image Text](images/9_4.png "Body image")


**Virutal Network Subnet**

* Connect VNets in different region and subscriptions 
* **Requires a VNet Gateway** 
* Provides a secure tunnel

### Create a virtual network using the portal


When you **enable an service endpoint**, the service or services to the virtual network, the service or services are secured to the VN

![Alt Image Text](images/9_6.png "Body image")

**Add subnet**

![Alt Image Text](images/9_7.png "Body image")


### Create a virtual network using PowerShell


```
#Create VNet and subnets 

#Parameters 
$RG = 'PSVTet' 
$Location = 'Canada Central' 

#Create a Resource Group 
New-AzResourceGroup -ResourceGroupName $RG -Location $Location 

#Create a Vnet 
$virtualNetwork New-AzVirtualNetwork` 
	-ResourceGroupName $RG 
	-Location $Location 
	-Name 'VNetPS' 
	-AddressPrefix 10.0.0.0/16 
	
#Add a Subnet 
$subnetconfig Add-AZVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig `
	-Name FrontEnd `
	-AddressPrefix 10.0.1.0/24  `
	-VirtualNetwork $virtualNetwork 

#Assign the subnet to the VNet 
$virtualNetwork | Set-AzVirtual Network 

#Add another subnet 
$subnetConfig Add-AzvirtualNetworksubnetconfig ` 
	-Name BackEnd ` 
	-AddressPrefix 10.0.2.0/24 `
	-virtualNetwork $virtualNetwork 

#Assign the subnet to the VNet 
$virtualNetwork |set-AzvirtualNetwork 

#Review the VNet 
Get-AZVirtualNetwork -ResourceGroupName $RG -Name 'VNetPS' 
```


### Create a network interface

* Create Network Interface

![Alt Image Text](images/9_8.png "Body image")

* Configure IP configuration

![Alt Image Text](images/9_9.png "Body image")

* Attach Network Interface to VM

![Alt Image Text](images/9_10.png "Body image")


### Azure IP addressing overview

**Public IP** 

* Connect to the Internet 
* Connect to other Azure public-facing s
	* ervices SQL Databases 


**Public IP SKUs**

* Basic 
* Standard 

**Public IP Basic SKU** 

* Static or dynamic allocation 
* Open by default 
* <span style="color:red">Restrict traffic using NSGs</span>
* Do not support Availability Zones 

**Public IP Standard SKU** 

* Static allocation 
* Closed to inbound traffic 
* **<span style="color:red">Use NSGs to whitelist traffic</span>** 
* Zone redundant by default 


**Public IP Assignments** 

* Virtual machines 
	* **Assigned to the primary NIC** 
* VPN Gateways 
	* Dynamic IP only 
* Application Gateways 
* Internet-facing load balancers 

**Public IP - Dynamic** 

* Default 
* Not assigned when the virtual machine is created 
* **Assigned during startup of the virtual machine** 
* **Released when the virtual machine is restarted, stopped or deallocated** 

**Public IP - Static** 

* The address is assigned when the virtual machine is provisioned 
* Never released 
	* Delete the resource 
	* Change to dynamic 
* IP is assigned from the Azure resource pool 


**Public Static IP Uses** 

* IP addresses linked to **SSL certificates** 
* Services that require a static IP 

**Best Practice**

* Microsoft recommends **not** applying the static IP to the OS of the virtual machine 
* Exception 
	* Assigning multiple IPs to the virtual machine 
	* Use the same IP address that has been assigned to the network interface 

**Private IPs** 

* Assigned to virtual machines within the VNet 
* Connect to an on-premise environment 
	* VPN Gateway 
	* ExpressRoute 
* Not accessible to the Internet 

**Private IP - Dynamic** 

* Default 
* Not assigned when the virtual machine is created
* Assigned during startup of the virtual machine 
* Released when the virtual machine is stopped 
* May change from reboot to reboot 


**Private IP - Static** 

* Assigned when the virtual machine is provisioned 
* Never released 
* Do not configure the private IP within the server 

> If you do this, this could result in failure and dropped connections

**Private Static IP Uses**

* Domain controllers 
* DNS servers 
* Other resources that need require a static IP for connectivity 


**DHCP**

* Azure controlled 
* Leases are for the lifetime of the virtual machine 

> But keeping in mind that we do no change the private IP address in the operating system 


### Configure virtual machine IP addresses using the portal

> When you create VM by default, a public, dynamic IP address is assigned automatically

![Alt Image Text](images/9_11.png "Body image")

**Configure IP configuration**

![Alt Image Text](images/9_12.png "Body image")


### Create a private IP address using PowerShell

```
#Create a Private IP 

#Variables 
$RG=  "PrivateIP" 
$Location = "Canada Central" 

New-AzResourceGroup -Name $RG -Location $Location 

# Create a subnet configuration 
$subnetconfig = New-AzvirtualNetworksubnetconfig 
	-Name Frontend 
	-AddressPrefix 10.4.0.0/24 

# Create a virtual network 
$VNet = New-AzVirtualNetwork `
	-ResourceGroupName $RG `
	-Location $Location `
	-Name VNET ` 
	-AddressPrefix 10.4.0.0/16 `
	-subnet $subnetConfig 
	
# Get the subnet object for use in a later step. 
$subnet Get-AzvirtualNetworksubnetconfig -Name $SubnetConfig Name -VirtualNetwork $VNet

$ipconfigName1 = "IPConfig1" 
$ipconfig1 = New-AzNetworkinterfaceipconfig `
	-Name $IpconfigName1 `
	-Subnet $subnet  `
	-PrivatelpAddress 10.4.0.4 `
	-Primary 

$NIC = New-AzNetworkInterface  `
		-Name NIC `
		-ResourceGroupName $RG  `
		-Location $Location `
		-Ipconfiguration $Ipconfig1

#view Network Interface 
Get-AZNetworkinterface -ResourceGroupName $RG 

#You would then assign this NIC to the vm 

```


### Create a public IP address

**Standrad Public IP**

![Alt Image Text](images/9_13.png "Body image")

A standard can only be assoicated with virtual machine or load balancer front end, only IPv4 is available 

**Basic SKU Public IP**

At this time, IPv6 can only be associated to internet-facing load balancer, a dynamic address is assigned after the resource has been started.

A reboot or stopped, but not deallocated, **virtual machine will retain the dynamic IP**, wherear a static IP is assigned when the public IP is created and does not changed. 

A static IP will not be released until the public IP address is deleted 

**Associate public IP address to `load balancer` and `Network interface`**


![Alt Image Text](images/9_14.png "Body image")


### Azure route table overview

**Workflow**

![Alt Image Text](images/9_15.png "Body image")

**Next Hop Options** 

* Virtual appliance 
* Virtual Network Gateway 
* Virtual Network 
* Internet 
* None (traffic is dropped) 

**Network Security Groups & Route Tables** 

* Separate entities 
* Both are applied to a Subnet 
* NSG 
	* **Security rules to allow or deny traffic** 
* Route Table 
	* **Direct traffic** 

**Considerations**

* Routes can be overridden or 
* Routes can be combined with the default Azure routes 
* Routes with the longest prefix are used first 
	* `10.0.0.0/24` will be used over `10.0.0.0/16` if the next hop address is in n both prefixes 

**Sequence for Routing** 

* User-defined route 
* BGP route 
* System route 



### Create and configure a network route using the portal

## 4. Create and Configure a Network Security Group


### Network Security Group (NSG) overview

**What is a Network Security Group** 

* List of Rules 
* **<span style="color:green">Allow or Deny Traffic</span>** 
* Applied to 
	* **Subnet** — affects all the virtual machines in the subnet 
	* **Network Interface** — affects the virtual machine 
* **Inbound or Outbound** 


**Nsg Workflow**

![Alt Image Text](images/9_33.png "Body image")

**Default Inbound Security Rules** 

* AllowVNetInBound 
* **AllowAzureLoadBalancerInBound**
* DenyAllInBound 

![Alt Image Text](images/9_34.png "Body image")

> The last rule in the **inbound security rules** is **DenyAllInBound**

**Default Outbound Security Rules** 

* AllowVnetOutbound 
* AllowInternetOutBound 
* DenyAllOutBound 

![Alt Image Text](images/9_35.png "Body image")

**Rules**

* Source, Source Port Range 
* Destination, Destination Port Range 
* Protocol 
	* Any, tcp, udp
* Action 
	* Allow, Deny
* Priority - Microsoft recommends increments of a 100 
*  Name 

> And Microsoft does recommend that your port range here be any or an asterisk


### Create an NSG rule
