# Interactive Staging

* Interactive Mode
* Patch Mode
* Split a hunk `s`
* Edit a hunk  with `e` option mamually change

## Interactive Mode

### Interactive Staging 

* Stage changes interactively  
* Allows staging portions of changed files 
* Helps to make smaller, focused commits 
* Feature of many Git GUI tools 

```
$ git add --interactive
$ git add -i
```

### Demo

**There some un-commit changes**

```
(master) $ git status 
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'. 
Changes not staged for commit: 
	(use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed) 
	(use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory) 
	
	modified: README.md
	modified: shopping.txt
	modified: to_do.txt
Untracked files: 
	(use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed) 
	
	party_invites.txt 
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a") 
```

### interactive update 

```

### Check final result

```
(master) > git status 
On branch master 
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes to be committed: 
	(use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage) 
	new file: modified: 
	party_invites.txt to_do.txt 

Changes not staged for commit: 
	(use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
	(use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory) 
	
	modified: modified: 
	README.md shopping.txt 
```

## Patch Mode

### Patch Mode 

* Allows staging portions of a changed file (part of file)
* "Hunk": an area where two files differ 
* Hunks can be staged, skipped, or split into smaller hunks 

### Demo: Patch Mode in interactive mode

```

## Split a hunk

**A hunk can contain multiple changes and it can seem sometimes arbitrary how Git decides which changes get put into each hunk.**

Sometimes we want those changes to be split up so that we can stage only a portion of that hunk. 

* Hunks can contain multiple changes 
* Tell Git to try to split a hunk further 
* Requires one or more unchanged lines between changes 


### Demo: split the hunk

## Edit a hunk  with `e` option mamually change

* Can edit a hunk manually 
* Most useful when a hunk cannot be split automatically 
* Diff-style line prefixes: `+, -, #, space `
