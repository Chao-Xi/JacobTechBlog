# How does DNS work?


1. **You input domain name(`www.example.com.`) (url)** (There is finale dot inside the url)
2. **Resolving Name Server(According to the `dot` to find root name server)**
3. **Root Name Server** (get query find **com** name server)
4. **TLD(Top Level Domain) Name Server** [Get query, find `example.com` in name server, with help of Domain Register]
5. **Authoritative Name Server**
6. **Give the IP address back**
