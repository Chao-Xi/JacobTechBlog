## Sprint Refinement

### Input

Backlog / Item 

### Process

* Sprint N+2
* **Story Split**
	* User Value
	* Acceptance Criteria
	* Spkie

* **Share** 
	* Team Agreement

* T-Shirt Sizing (INVEST: Independent / Negotiable / Valuable / Estimable / Small / Testable)
	* Silent
	* Bounce
	* Estimation

* Re-rank
	* urgent


### **Formats of Acceptance Criteria** 

**Behavior Driven Development format** 

* Given `<some precondition>` and/or `<an alternative precondition>` 
* When `<some action by the role>` and/or `<some other action by the role>` 
* Then `<some testable outcome is achieved>` and `<some other testable outcome is achieved>
* but `<some testable exception is achieved>` 


**Example**: 

Given an order is in progress, when the order gets placed successfully then a unique order number is generated 



### **Typical User Story Formats** 

**User Story format** 

* As a `<type of user>` Who are we building it for, who the user is? 
* I want `<some goal or objective >` What are we building, what is the intention? 
* So that `<benefit, value>` Why are we building it, what value it bring for the user? 



Examples: 

* As a online shopper, I want to know the order number, so that I can track/cancel my order 
* As a stock dealer, I want to know the closing price of a stock, so that I can decide to sell or hold
