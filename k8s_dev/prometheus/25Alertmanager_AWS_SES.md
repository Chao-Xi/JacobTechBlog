### Set up DKIM for your verified domain to authenticate email in Amazon SES (Production only)

Reference: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/send-email-authentication-dkim-easy-setup-domain.html

DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) is a standard that allows senders to sign their email messages with a cryptographic key. Email providers then use these signatures to verify that the messages weren't modified by a third party while in transit. The reason why we need to authenticate emails for production environment is mentioned at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/send-email-authentication.html.

* To set up Easy DKIM for a domain
* Open the Amazon SES console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ses/.
* In the navigation pane, under **Identity Management**, choose **Domains**.
* In the list of domains, choose the domain that you want to set up Easy DKIM for.
* Under **DKIM**, choose **Generate DKIM Settings**.
* Copy the three CNAME records that appear in this section like below screenshot as example.

* Add the CNAME records to the DNS configuration for your domain in your domain's DNS serve
